This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The issue is that Tailwind's purge functionality might not correctly identify and remove unused CSS classes, especially when using dynamic class names or components with conditionally applied classes.  This leads to larger-than-necessary CSS files, impacting performance.  Example showing dynamic classes:

```javascript
function MyComponent({isActive}) {
  return (
    <div className={`bg-${isActive ? 'red-500' : 'blue-500'} p-4`}>
      {isActive ? 'Active' : 'Inactive'}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Without proper configuration, Tailwind might not detect `bg-red-500` or `bg-blue-500` as used, resulting in their inclusion even if the component never renders with them.
